## <a id='architecture'></a> Architecture Overview

The Splunk Firehose Nozzle for VMware Tanzu is a VMware Tanzu Application Service for virtual machines (VMs) app.
The nozzle subscribes to the Loggregator endpoint and writes events to an external Splunk platform environment.

![Report Example: Basic Nozzle Architecture](images/overview.png)
<strong><center>Figure 1: Basic Nozzle Architecture</center></strong>

<strong>Inside each nozzle:</strong>

* A Golang routine collects events from the Loggregator endpoint using v1 api.
* An in-memory queue buffers events for availability to multiple Splunk HTTP Event Collector clients.
* The Splunk HTTP Event Collector clients run with their own Golang routines that consume events from the queue to enrich VMware Tanzu events by attaching metadata fields.
* Finally, the events are batched together and sent to Splunk via the HEC endpoint.

## <a id='load-balancing'></a> Splunk Load Balancing Overview

In Splunk platform environments with multiple servers, each with their own configured HEC endpoints; a physical or logical load balancer is needed to distribute each request to each Splunk platform server. The collection of HEC endpoints can reside on either a
cluster of Splunk heavy forwarders or Splunk indexers, depending on the specific environment configuration.

If you use a load balancer, the address of the load balancer needs to be configured in the setting for HTTP Event Collector Endpoint (HEC) URL found on the Splunk Settings configuration page.

## <a id='performance'></a> Performance and Sizing Guide

Splunk Inc. has tested the Splunk Firehose Nozzle for VMware Tanzu Architecture running as a single deployed nozzle on the AWS instance type c4.4xlarge.
This EC2 instance type has 8 CPU and 32 GB memory. Storage is EBS-Only and has dedicated EBS Bandwidth of 2,000 Mbps.

Tests were performed with structured and unstructured data with 2 different event sizes 256 and 1024 bytes.
Averaged performance metrics over an extended period of time resulted in the following results:

Tests | Events per Second (EPS) | Mbps | Nozzle CPU (%) | Nozzle Mem Total (MB)
  --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
  Structured Data (JSON) - 256 byte event size        | `9444`|`7.30`|`530.6`|`57.2`
  Structured Data (JSON) - 1024 byte event size       | `6775`|`10.90`|`567.9`|`79.9`
  Unstructured Data - 256  byte event size            |`11189`|`9.10`|`502.3`|`58.3`
  Unstructured Data - 1024 byte event size            | `9487`|`16.03`|`491.5`|`82.8`

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Nozzle CPU (%) 100% means that a single core is wholly dedicated to the Nozzle.<br>
   500% means five cores are wholly dedicated.<br>
   Factoring these optimal testing numbers, Splunk recommends that to run a single Splunk nozzle instance,
   you use a system with at least 8 CPUs and 300&nbsp;MB RAM.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Performance results should be taken as a guide only as different configurations and environments may vary results.</p>

###<a id='indexrouting'></a> Index routing

Use index routing to send different Cloud Foundry logs to different indexes for better Audit Command Language (ACL) and data retention control in your Splunk platform deployment.

1. Configure application index routing via application manifest
Navigate to your deployment's your app manifest, and provide an environment variable named `SPLUNK_INDEX` and assign it the index you would like to send the app data to. Make sure Splunk nozzle is configured with `Add App Info` (Select at least one of AppName,OrgName,OrgGuid,SpaceName,SpaceGuid) to enable app info caching.

```
applications:
- name: console
  memory: 256M
  disk_quota: 256M
  host: console
  timeout: 180
  buildpack: go
  health-check-type: port
  env:
    SPLUNK_INDEX: testing_index
    <note>Verify SPLUNK_INDEX exists on your Splunk platform deployment. Otherwise data will be lost.</note>
```

1. Index routing via Splunk configuration

Logs can be routed using fields such as app ID/name, space ID/name or org ID/name.

Configure the Splunk configuration files props.conf and transforms.conf on your Splunk platform indexers or Splunk platform heavy forwarders, if deployed.

The following are example index routing configurations:

<span>1. </span> Example: Route data from application ID `95930b4e-c16c-478e-8ded-5c6e9c5981f8` to a Splunk `prod` index:

*$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/props.conf*
```
[cf:logmessage]
TRANSFORMS-index_routing = route_data_to_index_by_field_cf_app_id
```


*$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/transforms.conf*
```
[route_data_to_index_by_field_cf_app_id]
REGEX = "(\w+)":"95930b4e-c16c-478e-8ded-5c6e9c5981f8"
DEST_KEY = _MetaData:Index
FORMAT = prod
```


<span>2.</span> Example: Route application logs from any Cloud Foundry organizations whose names are prefixed with `sales` to a Splunk software `sales` index.

*$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/props.conf*
```
[cf:logmessage]
TRANSFORMS-index_routing = route_data_to_index_by_field_cf_org_name

```

*$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/transforms.conf*
```
[route_data_to_index_by_field_cf_org_name]
REGEX = "cf_org_name":"(sales.*)"
DEST_KEY = _MetaData:Index
FORMAT = sales
```

<span>3.</span> Example: Route data from sourcetype `cf:splunknozzle` to index `new_index`:

*$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/props.conf*
```
[cf:splunknozzle]
TRANSFORMS-route_to_new_index = route_to_new_index
```

*$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/transforms.conf*
```
[route_to_new_index]
SOURCE_KEY = MetaData:Sourcetype
DEST_KEY =_MetaData:Index
REGEX = (sourcetype::cf:splunknozzle)
FORMAT = new_index
```
