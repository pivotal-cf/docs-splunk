This documentation describes the Splunk Firehose Nozzle for VMware Tanzu.
Splunk Firehose Nozzle integrates with VMware Tanzu Loggregator and forwards streaming logs and
metrics from user apps and system components of Cloud Foundry to Splunk Enterprise.
VMware Tanzu operators can then gain operational visibility over their VMware Tanzu
infrastructure, including the health and performance of their apps and system components.

For more information about Loggregator, see 
[Loggregator Architecture](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/application-service/loggregator/architecture.html).

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The Splunk Firehose Nozzle for VMware Tanzu Tile streams logs and metrics from VMware Tanzu and forwards them
to user-specified Splunk Enterprise indexers configured to receive data via [HTTP Event Collector](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector).
VMware Tanzu operators and Splunk users can immediately search and analyze VMware Tanzu Firehose data from their
Splunk Enterprise deployment to build reports, dashboards, and alerts on the health
and performance of their apps.

Splunk Firehose Nozzle for VMware Tanzu includes the following key features:

* Setup with out-of-the-box data parsing and enrichment for various VMware Tanzu event types.
* Reliable event delivery by leveraging Splunk's HTTP Event Collector endpoint.
* Secure forwarding from VMware Tanzu into external Splunk environments using user-provided SSL certificates.
* Scales out to meet increasing data volume and number of apps.
